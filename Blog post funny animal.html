        <p class="content">The great white shart is the deadliest predator in the ocean. It spends most of its
            time around schools of fish. It has also been known to make social media accounts, pretending to be smaller
            fish so it can lure them more efficiently. </p>

            The Margarets are one of the most fascinating animals on the planet. They play the titular game 'Among Us'
            before and after each feeding. Due to generational games of 'Among Us', they have above average social
            skills compared to other savanna animals. Occasionally, the family might consider one of them what
            scientists call "sus" and violently murder the impostor.

            Warms are another fantastic organism. Their slime is known to have exfoliating properties. Similar to how
            bees surround large predators and beat their wings at high speeds to kill them from heat, covering yourself
            in a moderate quantity of warms will keep you warm, hence the name. They shit out of their mouths.
